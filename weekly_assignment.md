##### Trello group
I've now created a Trello group for this course, which is available at the following URL,

I'll send an invite to this group to each student's LUC email address.

If you do not currently have a Trello username, you'll need to register at the following URL,

##### Slack group
I've also created a Slack group for this course, which is called **COMP 460**.

I'll send an invite to this group to each student's LUC email address.

Please accept this invite as soon as possible. We shall be using Slack for class-wide communication, announcements, and discussions.
